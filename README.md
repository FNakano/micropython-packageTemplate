# Package Template

Package Template

(meta) Considerations

1. I believe running through a simple tutorial or a simple example is the most natural way to learn something.
   - but *simple* examples may get complicated as the author knowledge evolves. I'll try not to do this.
2. This example is based on https://github.com/jimmo/micropython-mlx90640 (forked on Sept, 15, 2024)
   - added a working function into `packageTemplate.utils` in order to provide a more useful example

## Objective

Show how to create Micropython packages with explanations (as detailed as possible/manageable)

### The shortest path (by now)
